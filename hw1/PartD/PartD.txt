This is a scene from my favourite game last summer, Slime Rancher. 
In this scene, there are eight "plorts" of different colors on the gate 
that will light up once the corresponding "plorts" are put into their 
places. I find this scene beautiful and uplifting, just by seeing those
plorts light up one by one. I surmise that all these plorts all emit
point lights from themselves. Once it's activated, the light value sets to
true and illuminate its designated color. These lights also generate moving spiral
around them, which is really cool. The light will adjust with the camera angle, 
so if the player is next to those lights, the light diffusion and position seem right. 

We can see that in this scene, the player is
facing the direction that the sunlight comes from. In this case, the game does
the shadow accurately because we can see that the gate backing the sun projects the
shadows. This scene has enough sunlight, and it looks like a beautiful sunny day. 
All of the objects in this scene are textured. I'm not sure if they are updated pixels
by pixels, but it doesn't look like their texture are being updated either. Looks more
like there's an offset for shadow that add to the existing pixel color (rgb or intensity)
to make it look darker.
