Part A:

	My part A is called "drifting away". The height map is drifting away from this shore. 
	The water body is also moving along the height map. The height map has four layers of 
	texture. 

Part B:

	My part B is called "poop volcano". The poop mountain in the middle is effusing fire
	sparks. The intensity of the lava is adjustable. There are some textured point sprite
	in the air that represnts the fire ashes. I think it's a very beautiful scene. Hope
	you enjoy it.
