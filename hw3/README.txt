This is my homework number 3. 

My part B is called "Spinning". The geometries are created using SDF, of course. I'm fascinated by the power of SDF.
One of them is a box geometry that oscillates between morphing into a sphere and a box with holes. This is create by simply using 
difference and union function with a sin(time) offset. One other geometry is showing the union of box and ball. And the 
last one is the subtraction of the box from the ball, so the ball disappears at where the box is. The whole scene is spinning at an interesting rate. The color of ambient lighting is also changing. I hope you enjoy this scene.
